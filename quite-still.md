# Quite Still

Quite still
I watch the outlines of thoughts
While around shallow words I speak and hear
Move but don't interfere

Swaying curves
Like arms moving slow and precise
A point where the light starts dripping down
While the radio speaks out

I run my finger along my thoughts
My mind sweeping with geometrical force
Remote image, yet so close
Sliding through memory
Defining my days like laser beams

Deep looks
Surfacing voice on the phone
But my thoughts is as sharp as an ad
Reaching the target precise

Flue image
Hallucinating my life
Like celluloid loves
While I watch
Alone my flat TV set

I run my finger along my thoughts
My mind sweeping with geometrical force
Remote image, yet so close
Sliding through memory
Defining my days like laser beams
