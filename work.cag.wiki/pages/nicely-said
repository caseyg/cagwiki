You could promise to entertain your readers or teach them something new. Set yourself apart by telling people how you’re different. These facts are useful for readers.\n\nEmotional messages — Emotional messages appeal to people’s feelings, hopes, and dreams. They’re more aspirational, and show a softer side. Where the organization is fun, you could spell that out. Say what you’ll do to make readers happy, satisfy their curiosity, or brighten their day. If you know your readers are passionate about something, you can appeal to that too.\n\nReputation-based messages — You can also talk about your reputation. Some people want solid proof that they’re making a good choice. If you have a presence on social media sites, include those links.\n "
