So one of the things I did is deeply start to buy these books that are related, because I had a reading list and I figured, like, I need to make this tangible for myself. I actually have one more of these, but these were like ridiculous splurges. One of them is much harder to get, the one that I didn't bring in. It's literally falling apart and was literally made by hand by Ted Nelson, I think. He's just this completely bonkers guy. A lot of these things remind me of people in the class. There's a lot about 3D modeling and learning. The other shift in my research is that I've been looking a lot at music. So these are all about music composition. I was thinking that I've been having a hard time explaining this technology stuff, and it feels really expected and boring and inaccessible, or something, and just obtuse? But I'm finding a lot of resonance and also just a lot of really nice stuff in the work of avant-garde composers based in New York and California that were all part of this collaborative group, so I'm kind of on an acid trip about that.\n"

And the last research thing is: this is a book called \"A Pattern Language\" by Christopher Alexander. This book inspired the creator of the wiki, because it's a codex, so it's written in a bound form, but it's kind of interlinked, internally. Ward Cunningham, who wrote the first wiki software, and who writes the wiki software that I'm now using said that this is like what gave him the idea. And the last thing is that I like randomly joined a video chat with the wiki creator guy Ward Cunningham. But I had to leave after like five minutes, so I'm hoping to actually talk to that guy. Because he like makes himself available. Yeah.
