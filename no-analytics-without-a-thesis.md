# No Analytics Without a Thesis


THIS IS STILL TKTKTK

(Working on it, before launch. And have about 10 more posts lined up for the coming weeks.)

Google is spying on everyone

Data-driven design requires a thesis, stopdesign Google

Do you actually have the resources?

Feeds a sense of vanity

People like medium trying to find new metrics

I believe in intuition and common sense

If you're collecting data just to collect it. Then keep it on the backburner.

As the educator margaret edson says: if data were a pie I would have a slice, but I didn't become a teacher to produce data. And likewise, I didn't become a web designer to produce metrics.

Goodbye, Google

> Without a person at (or near) the helm who thoroughly understands the principles and elements of Design, a company eventually runs out of reasons for design decisions. With every new design decision, critics cry foul. Without conviction, doubt creeps in. Instincts fail. “Is this the right move?” When a company is filled with engineers, it turns to engineering to solve problems. Reduce each decision to a simple logic problem. Remove all subjectivity and just look at the data. Data in your favor? Ok, launch it. Data shows negative effects? Back to the drawing board. And that data eventually becomes a crutch for every decishttion, paralyzing the company and preventing it from making any daring design decisions.

> Yes, it’s true that a team at Google couldn’t decide between two blues, so they’re testing 41 shades between each blue to see which one performs better. I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3, 4 or 5 pixels wide, and was asked to prove my case. I can’t operate in an environment like that. I’ve grown tired of debating such minuscule design decisions. There are more exciting design problems in this world to tackle.
