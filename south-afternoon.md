# South Afternoon

Dazzling pink flamencos
An hombre with sombrero
Brings an iced green drink with a crisp tortilla
A tropical revival lovely day

Thoughts and polished beauty
Whole vacation feeling
Discovering this day is filtered through a plastic screen
Cineramic landscape
Wilderness is fiction
Quartz sun rays highlight its pure form

I see my thoughts in the still southafternoon
While time goes by, Sunday is near the end
Life span in a Holiday Inn

Green electric leaves
Many perfect palms
Small triangled sails slide on a chlorine blue sea
Artificial rainbows
Colours have their wavelength
Seagulls draw a diagram up high

Just the right environment
To learn intensive Spanish
High degree of speed of syntax falling in place
Words are learned with ease
El hombre habla idiomas
Mejor hablan las computadoras

I see my thoughts in the still southafternoon
While time goes by, Sunday is near the end
Life span in a Holiday Inn

Sitting on a patio
I scan a glowing terminal
Sipping liquide phonemes with my mint-iced green drink
Computer has the angles
To teach us with facility
A tropical revival lovely day

I see my thoughts in the still southafternoon
While time goes by, Sunday is near the end
Life span in a Holiday Inn
