# Questions from Talks

[[Yale School of Art (2017/04/07)]]

Q: I have a question: the image of that hat, where does that symbol live now? Or by applying it to a hat, what do that do for you?

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the text on the windows?

Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your larp project?

Q: Did you do any larps at the conference?

Q: Could you speak more to telecommunications?

Q: So I have this impression that one of the difficulties you must face is the translating of research and ideas from more of an activist-sounding position to an art context, and I pinpoint Ned Ludd as someone who’s very hard to explain to somebody who’s only ever heard the word luddite as a definition that means anti-technology, but at the same time is this really complicated character that I’m sure you’d like to unpack and kind of present. It must be very difficult, or I guess I’m just curious if you come up against these kinds of blocks or how you would consider your transitioning, or what you have to do inside of that movement, if that makes sense?

[[The Oxbow School (2016/11/08)]]

Q: You talked a lot about your activism. I was wondering if you've ever incorporated activism into your art or art into your activism?

[[Vera List Center (2016/09/08)]]

Q: Hi, I have a question about...actually this slide is a good sample for my question. Looking through this book briefly here before the talk and seeing things like this, it seems like you're using language in this particular way and creating this kind of feeling of disarray and sort of nonsense, or something like that. Can you talk about that, and how that connects with the other stuff you've created?

Q: Good evening. Thanks a lot for the presentation and the material, it's extremely stimulating. I have a question that relates to the title of the Vera List Center project which is Post Democracy. You explained the process that led you to thinking of the Cooper Union adventure-misadventure as an illustration of Post Democracy, and kind of at the end of this exposé then I somehow wonder about the theme of Post Democracy: How does that fit? When you speak about the project, about the sounds, the forms, the values, the feelings, etc. I wonder how you manage to carry it. This checklist of non-transparency, the fact is you know you have those consulting bodies making decisions. And this is very strong in the beginning of your presentation with Occupy Wall Street, the Antioch, and such. So how do you manage to bring this theme of Post Democracy into this more kaleidoscopic quality of the project, the way I perceive it? And maybe it's not a nice question but do you feel impeded by the theme of Post Democracy to carry your project? Or how do you bring those two things together? But congratulations, great stuff.

Q: This is something I grapple with coming from Canada, I work here at The New School, and in Canada all our post-secondary education is public, not free as it should be but here, at a private university—and Cooper is private, right?—I wonder, and this is a genuine question, what sense it makes to talk about private universities in the context of any kind of democracy, right? Post- or pre- or explicitly anti-. So I'm interested in how you're thinking about private institutions in relation to democracy post-, pre-, or actual.

Q: So first, just on a very personal note, your presentation for me, as a veteran of one of those sit-ins at a university many years ago, at a visceral level, your presentation and your work is amazing. It's awesome. And I haven't had a lot of that visceral sense in many years. And so I would urge you to keep that part in future presentations. It's an important element. For those of us especially that like to remember those times. The question I have for you is how you think about personhood or agency or whatever word you want to use, whatever terminology works for you, in the midst of all of this. You've danced around it a bit. And I'm just curious both how you think about it and how that will feature in in the future as you're moving the project forward?

Q: So so much of your time has been spent specifically on Cooper but then also a little more tangentially with education. New York can you see and it almost seems like Cooper has become a really successful model for all of these ideas you guys have about architecture real estate institutional space and the disenfranchisement that can happen under these things. But this model that you guys built it seems like it could be pretty easily transposed on to so many other issues. And I'm wondering if that's sort of like bubbling which you guys already you know because so much has been on packed with Cooper with you guys and I'm wondering like I guess I'm asking the next step.
