I have a question that relates to the title of the Vera List Center project which is Post Democracy. You explained the process that led you to thinking of the Cooper Union adventure-misadventure as an illustration of Post Democracy, and kind of at the end of this exposé then I somehow wonder about the theme of Post Democracy: How does that fit? When you speak about the project, about the sounds, the forms, the values, the feelings, etc. I wonder how you manage to carry it. This checklist of non-transparency, the fact is you know you have those consulting bodies making decisions. And this is very strong in the beginning of your presentation with Occupy Wall Street, the Antioch, and such. So how do you manage to bring this theme of Post Democracy into this more kaleidoscopic quality of the project, the way I perceive it? And maybe it's not a nice question but do you feel impeded by the theme of Post Democracy to carry your project? Or how do you bring those two things together? But congratulations, great stuff."

For those of us especially that like to remember those times. The question I have for you is how you think about personhood or agency or whatever word you want to use, whatever terminology works for you, in the midst of all of this. You've danced around it a bit. And I'm just curious both how you think about it and how that will feature in in the future as you're moving the project forward?\n"

But this model that you guys built it seems like it could be pretty easily transposed on to so many other issues. And I'm wondering if that's sort of like bubbling which you guys already you know because so much has been on packed with Cooper with you guys and I'm wondering like I guess I'm asking the next step."
