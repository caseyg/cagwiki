# My Time

Stored on the shelves of my memory
my thoughts are in perfect array

My life runs smooth like a highway
billboards show me the way

My way of life has the glamour
of an artificial neon ad

I need overwhelming information
for a complete shopping list

Acrylic colours oscillate my eyes
when I wal down a drugstore aisle

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

Stored on the shelves of my memory
my thoughts are in perfect array

I learn do it yourself cybernetics
while I'm jogging on a rolling tray

I love my weekends in the pure air
on the heights of the Eiffel tower

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

My life runs smooth like a highway
billboards show me the way

My love stories have the flavour
of a swiss made digital watch

When I have to know what to love
I recall my stored data

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time

My thoughts are still like a photo
in the hall of a Hilton Hotel

My reflex actions are mechanized
like japanese camera tourists

happily milling in Bloomingdales
shooting at beautiful symbols

My time my time I love my time
My time has something more
My time's the best there's ever been
My time I love my time
Thank you my time
